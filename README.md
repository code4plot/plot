The -plot.- project

I am a Developmental Biologist studying the origin and formation of our tissues.  The advent of high-throughput technologies in Biology has churned out massive amount of data that need processing and presentation to realize its full value, much akin to precious metals and stones.  The 'plot' project aims to visualize data, from publicly available data to personal data I collect.  Turning a spreadsheet of numbers into an intuitive and meaningful graph is an art I hope to perfect through this project.  This blog should serve as a resource and a learning platform to everyone.

Please feel free to use anything useful on this blog, and you are also more than welcomed to contribute by dropping in suggestions, criticisms, and comments.  If you have found any plots useful, a simple gratitude and acknowledgement of my work goes a long way.  Cheers! - Jason Lai
